# Welcome to FixMyStreet Platform

FixMyStreet Platform is an open source project to help people run websites for
reporting common street problems such as potholes and broken street lights to
the appropriate authority.

Users locate problems using a combination of address and sticking a pin
in a map without worrying about the correct authority to report it to.
FixMyStreet then works out the correct authority using the problem location and
type and sends a report, by email or using a web service such as Open311.
Reported problems are visible to everyone so they can see if something has
already been reported and leave updates. Users can also subscribe to email or
RSS alerts of problems in their area.

It was created in 2007 by [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) for reporting
problems to UK councils and has been copied around the world.

## Installation

We're working hard to make FixMyStreet Platform easy to install and re-use in
other countries - please see our site at <http://code.fixmystreet.com/> for
