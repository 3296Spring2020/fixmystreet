Welcome to FixMyStreet Platform
===============================

<p class="lead">mySociety's geographic problem reporting platform.</p>

[FixMyStreet](http://www.fixmystreet.com/) Platform is an open source project
to help people run websites for reporting common street problems such as
potholes and broken street lights to an appropriate authority.

Users locate problems using a combination of address and sticking a pin in a
map without worrying about the correct authority to report it to. FixMyStreet
then works out the correct authority using the problem location and type and
sends a report, by email or using a web service such as Open311. Reported
problems are visible to everyone so they can see if something has already been
reported and leave updates. Users can also subscribe to email or RSS alerts of
problems in their area.

It was created in 2007 by [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) for reporting
problems to UK councils and has been copied around the world.

We're working hard to make FixMyStreet Platform easy to install and re-use in
other countries and welcome questions about how it works
[on our mailing list](https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/fixmystreet).

We also have a [guide](The-FixMyStreet-Platform-DIY-Guide-v1.1.pdf) on the technical and non-technical how and why of
using the FixMyStreet platform for your own site.

We've also got a [blog](blog/) where we will post updates in our progress
in making the code easier to install and develop.
