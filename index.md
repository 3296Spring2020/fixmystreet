Welcome to FixMyStreet
======================

[FixMyStreet](http://www.fixmystreet.com/) is an open source project to help
people run websites for reporting common street problems such as potholes and
broken street lights to the appropriate authority.

Users locate problems using a combination of address and sticking a pin in a
map without worrying about the correct authority to report it to. FixMyStreet
then works out the correct authority using the problem location and type and
sends a report, by email or using a web service such as Open311. Reported
problems are visible to everyone so they can see if something has already been
reported and leave updates. Users can also subscribe to email or RSS alerts of
problems in their area.

It was created in 2007 by [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) for reporting
problems to UK councils and has been copied around the world.

We're working hard to make it easy to install and re-use in other
countries and welcome questions about how it works
[on our mailing list](https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/fixmystreet).

We've also got a [new blog](http://code.fixmystreet.com/) which over time will
become a useful resource for people interested in installing or developing
FixMyStreet.
