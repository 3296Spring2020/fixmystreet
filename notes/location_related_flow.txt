--- '/' ---

    Homepage has a search form that submits to /around. There is no location
    processing done on the home page. Any queries sent to the homepage are
    redirected to /around.

--- '/around' ---

    SEARCH: allows user to search for a location using postcode or other text.
    If nothing matched error shown. If multiple match show alternatives.

    LIST: If a search could be resolved to a lat/lon, or a lot/lon was in query
    show matches near that location.

    PARTIAL: If there is a partial token show a message when searching. When a
    match is found redirect to '/report/new' for the partial to be completed.

--- '/report/new' ---

    Requires a lat/lng, or a tile click, or a partial report with a location
    stored. If no location can be deteremined redirects back to '/around'. All
    form information is lost but the partial token is preserved.
