display_may needs a properly faked $q so it can choose a cobrand. Or should it be ported to use new cobrand?

change uri_for to use cobrand->url so we don't have to

should we ditch flickr import? (does not seem to be getting huge usage and those using it would probably report using another method: http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=fixmystreet&m=tags)

move all FAQ over to TT2
