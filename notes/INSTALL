# INSTALLING FROM SCRATCH

# mySociety applications are intended to be run on a Debian system. Other Linux
# distributions may well work but may also require some tweaking.

# This document assumes that you are starting with a bare Debian Lenny box and
# that you want to install the latest code from GitHub. For some step you will
# need root access (via sudo)



# GETTING THE CODE


# bring your system up-to-date
# FIXME - ???should we specify any extras apt sources???
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# ensure that you have 'git' installed
sudo apt-get install git-core

# fetch the FixMyStreet code from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet.git

# fetch the submodules too
cd fixmystreet
git submodule update --init


# SETTING UP SYSTEM

# change into project directory
cd ~/fixmystreet

# check that you have all the packages needed. mySociety projects always have a
# file in 'conf/packages' where any debian ones needed are listed
sudo apt-get install `cat conf/packages`

# also install these that are available by default on mySoc boxes:
sudo apt-get install \
    libregexp-common-perl php5-cli perl-doc


# SETTING UP APACHE

cd /etc/apache2

# there is an apache config file in 'conf/httpd.conf' - insert it as per sample
# config at top of file into your /etc/apache2/ config setup
sudo nano sites-available/fixmystreet
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/fixmystreet sites-enabled/

# you may need to enable some modules too
sudo ln -s ../mods-available/rewrite.load     mods-enabled/
sudo ln -s ../mods-available/proxy.load       mods-enabled/
sudo ln -s ../mods-available/proxy_http.load  mods-enabled/

# check the config and restart apache
sudo apache2ctl configtest
sudo apache2ctl restart

cd -

# You may need to change the permissions on your files so that apache can read them


# SETTING UP EMAIL SENDING

# FixMyStreet sends lots of email - your dev server should be able to deliver
# them. If you're running a virtual machine consider sending all email via
# Gmail by replacing exim with ssmtp.
apt-get install ssmtp    # will probably uninstall existing MTA
apt-get install mailx    # for testing email is working

nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf    # see http://wiki.debian.org/sSMTP for details
mail youremail@example.com    # send a test message

# SETTING UP CONFIG FILES

# the setup is configured using the file 'conf/general' - copy the example one and then edit it
cp conf/general-example conf/general
nano conf/general

# You only need to alter:
#  * the database connection details
#  * the OPTION_BASE_URL to be where your test site will run - eg 'http://localhost'
#  * the OPTION_EVEL_URL to '' - this will cause some emails not to be sent but warned to STDERR instead - proper email handling is being worked on
#  * the OPTION_SMTP_SMARTHOST to '' if routing mail via ssmtp as described above - otherwise your SMTP server
#  * set OPTION_EMAIL_VHOST to the same as OPTION_BASE_URL minus the 'http://' - eg 'localhost'


# SETTING UP THE DATABASES

# create your own db user (as a superuser to make things easier)
sudo su - postgres
createuser -s your_username
exit

# You'll need to create a database, enable plpgsql and load in the schema
createdb -E SQL_ASCII bci
createlang plpgsql bci
psql bci < db/schema.sql
psql bci < db/alert_types.sql
