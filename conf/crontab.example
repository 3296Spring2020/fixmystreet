# Timed tasks for FixMyStreet.

# This is an example crontab that you may want to use as a basis for
# one on your own server.  You should replace $FMS with the path to the
# clone of the FixMyStreet repository that you are using.  You should
# also replace $LOCK_DIR with a writeable directory for the lock files.
