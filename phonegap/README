BUILDING
---------

The cordova.sj file in www is for bilding on the iPhone. In order
to build on android you need to replace it with the android_cordova.js
file in this directory.

If you Build on android and see an error about Cordova.exec before deviceready
then it's likely that you have forgotten this step.

To build on iPhone copy the iphone_cordova.js over the cordova.js in www.
