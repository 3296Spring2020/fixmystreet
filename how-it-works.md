How does FixMyStreet work?
==========================

Users locate problems quickly and easily without worrying about the correct
authority to report it to. FixMyStreet takes care of that using the problem
location and <a href="/glossary/#category" class="glossary">category</a>, and
sends a <a href="/glossary/#report" class="glossary">report</a>, by email or
using a web service such as <a href="/glossary/#open311"
class="glossary">Open311</a>.

FixMyStreet doesn't just send problem reports -- it makes the reports visible
to everyone. Anyone can see what's already been reported, leave <a
href="/glossary/#update" class="glossary">updates</a>, or subscribe to <a
href="/glossary/#alert" class="glossary">alerts</a>. We help prevent duplicate
reports and offer additional features for <a href="/glossary/#staff-user"
class="glossary">staff users</a> working for the authorities who are actually
fixing problems.
