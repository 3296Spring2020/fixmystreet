    <h2>The Empty Homes Agency</h2>

    <p>The Empty Homes agency is an independent campaigning charity. We are not
    part of government, and have no formal links with local councils although we
    work in cooperation with both. We exist to highlight the waste of empty
    property and work with others to devise and promote sustainable solutions to
    bring empty property back into use. We are based in London but work across
    England. We also work in partnership with other charities across the UK.</p>

    <h2>Shelter Cymru</h2>

    <p>Shelter Cymru is Wales&rsquo; people and homes charity and wants everyone
    in Wales to have a decent home. We believe a home is a fundamental right and
    essential to the health and well-being of people and communities. We work
    for people in housing need. We have offices all over Wales and prevent
    people from losing their homes by offering free, confidential and
    independent advice. When necessary we constructively challenge on behalf of
    people to ensure they are properly assisted and to improve practice and
    learning. We believe that bringing empty homes back into use can make a
    significant contribution to the supply of affordable homes in Wales. <a
