        <dt>What is FixMyBarangay?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyBarangay is a site to help people report, view,
or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found to the city departments.
The pilot project lets you report the problems by SMS (or dropping
into the barangay center).
</dd>
      <dt>What areas are covered?</dt>
      <dd>
          The pilot project is just running in two barangays in Cebu &ndash;
          Luz and Basak San Nicolas.
      </dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyBarangay?</dt>
        <dd>The FixMyBarangay pilot project is just for potholes (and similar 
          road surface problems) and broken streetlights.
        </dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t FixMyBarangay for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with Cebu City Hall for other problems
    &ndash; please use FixMyBarangay only for potholes and streetlights while the pilot 
    project is running.. 
    </dd>

        <dt>Staff only: How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>If you have a staff login, you can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>Problems sent by SMS are initially handled by the barangay staff &ndash; they'll
          confirm the problem and report it to the relevant department automatically. 
          Once it's in the department's problem-tracking system, they'll get onto it as 
          soon as they can.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. The pilot project has been funded by the World Bank.</dd>
