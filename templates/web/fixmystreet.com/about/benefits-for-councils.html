<h1>Everything councils need to know about FixMyStreet</h1>

<p>So you’re from a council and you’d like to find out more about FixMyStreet? Welcome! This page is for you.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>The FixMyStreet website and app are run by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, a not-for-profit that encourages people to become active citizens.</p>
<p>FixMyStreet makes it easy to report street faults: it covers the whole of the UK, and forwards users’ reports to the councils responsible for getting them fixed. At the same time, reports are published online for everyone to see.</p>
<p>We’ve been around since 2007, and during that time we’ve processed over a million reports.</p>
<h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
<p> Most people know that if they see something wrong in their local neighbourhood, they should report it to ‘the council’ —  but they don’t always know which council, especially with the UK’s two-tier system.
<p>Even if they do, it can still be a bother finding the right page of the council website and then, often as not, having to register or fill in a long form just to make a one-off report.
<p>Our aim has always been to make it as simple as possible to file a street report in just a few clicks. No fuss, no bother.
<h2>How does FixMyStreet benefit councils?</h2>
<p>In lots of ways! Here are the most obvious ones:
<ul>
<li>Reports are published online, and can be marked as fixed when they’re resolved. So all the previously-hidden hard work that you, the council, do to keep your streets maintained can now be seen by everyone.
<li>Citizens become the eyes of the council. Inspectors can’t be everywhere, so getting reports from the UK’s most-used fault reporting website keeps you up to date with everything that needs attention.
<li>You’ll receive FixMyStreet reports along with everything you need to get them resolved: the precise location on a map, along with lat-long co-ordinates, and a full description from the report-maker. Users also have the option to add photographs.
<li>You’ll receive far fewer duplicate reports, because users can see which issues have already been reported — and we’re actively working on technology to make duplicates even rarer.
<li>We’re happy to work with you so that the reporting form meets your internal requirements. We can change, add or remove category titles, and map them to whichever email addresses you prefer. Need the user to include certain information in reports? Let us know.
<li>By default, our reports are delivered by email, but if your set up requires email reports to be rekeyed, consider our offer to
    <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2013/09/09/councils-use-open311-and-youll-never-have-to-re-key-a-problem-report-from-fixmystreet-and-its-free/">integrate via Open311 for free</a>.
<li>Want something that speaks with all your existing software and drops reports right into the council’s internal systems? Check out our
    <a href="/pro/">FixMyStreet Pro service</a> for end to end interoperability.
</ul>
<h2>How does FixMyStreet benefit citizens?</h2>
<p>Your residents love us too. Here are a few reasons why:
<ul>
<li>No matter where in the UK they are, all they have to do is remember one web address: fixmystreet.com.
<li>They don’t have to find the right page on the right council website and then get to grips with its reporting system; it’s the same everywhere — and because FixMyStreet routes their reports to the right council, all the thinking’s done for them.
<li>We’ve been constantly developing FixMyStreet for over a decade, adopting the latest web capabilities and always putting usability at the forefront — so it’s quick and simple to make a report, and practically everyone can use the site without a problem.
<li>With all reports published online, FixMyStreet provides a historic picture of every neighbourhood, so everyone can see what the repeat or persistent issues are, and what gets fixed.
</ul>
<p>And we’re especially useful for:
<ul>
<li>People who travel around the country, and don’t always know which council area they’re in
<li>Those who aren’t especially internet-savvy, or who find complicated web interfaces intimidating
<li>People who make lots of reports, and would like to keep track of them all
<li>House-hunters who want to know more about the area in which they’re looking to buy
<li>Folk who like to make reports while they’re out and about
</ul>
