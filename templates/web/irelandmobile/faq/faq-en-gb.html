    <dl>
        <dt>What is FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is a site to help people report, view,
or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found to their local council by
simply locating them on a map. </dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is primarily for reporting things which are
<strong>broken or dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning
or clearing</strong>, such as:

    <ul><li>Abandoned vehicles
    <li>Dog Fouling
    <li>Flyposting or graffiti
    <li>Illegal dumping or litter
    <li>Streetcleaning, such as broken glass in a cycle lane
    <li>Unlit lamposts
    <li>Potholes
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t FixMyStreet for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with [% c.cobrand.is_council ? 'the' : 'your' %] council for all
    issues &ndash; please use FixMyStreet only for problems such as the above. <strong>You will need to contact [% c.cobrand.is_council ? 'the' : 'your' %] council
    directly</strong> for problems such as: 

    <ul><li>Anti-social behaviour
    <li>Any urgent or emergency problems
    <li>Noise pollution or barking dogs
    <li>Fires and smoke/smell pollution
    <li>Proposals for speed bumps/ CCTV/ pedestrian crossings/ new road layouts/ etc.
    <li>Complaining about your neighbours
    <li>Complaining about the council
    <li>Joy riding, drug taking, animal cruelty, or other criminal activity
    </ul>
    <p>Some councils have direct hotlines for these sorts of issues.</p>
    </dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented
with a map of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported to the [% IF !c.cobrand.is_council %]relevant[% END %] council by email. The
council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would.
Alternatively, you can discuss the problem on the website with others, and
then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. FixMyStreet is <strong>run
by volunteers</strong>, though, so do please bear that in mind if you're contacting us.</dd>

    <dt>Can I use FixMyStreet on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>This web site does not yet provide a wonderful web experience on small devices. We're working on fixing that as soon as possible.</dd>
    <dd>We're making native apps available more quickly. Watch this space. An Android app will become available before the end of September,
    an iOS app as soon as we can find a developer to publish it for us.</dd>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Android:</em> A volunteer from the UK, Anna Powell-Smith, wrote an app 
    which you can find on the 
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ie.fixmystreet">Google Play Store </a>.</li>
    <li><em>iPhone:</em> Coming <b>very</b> soon.</li><!--Our basic app from 2008 is available for download
    on the App Store:
    <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fixmystreet/id297456545">FixMyStreet</a>,-->
    <!-- <li><em>Nokia:</em> A volunteer, Thomas Forth, has written an app available from the
    <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/107557">Ovi Store</a>.

    <h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, where do you send the reports?</dt>
        <dd>You can either leave a test report or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where reports go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use. If your council is part of the FixYourStreet.ie trial project, 
you'll find reports made here are posted directly to there.</dd>
        <!--<dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, can we have FixMyStreet on our website?</dt>
        <dd>Yes you can! We offer branded, hosted versions of FixMyStreet for local council websites.
        <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/for-councils/fixmystreet/">Full details</a>.</dd> -->
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep FixMyStreet locally focused, so restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will let you see all
    the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the
    council then the emailed version of the problem report also contains the
    closest road and postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>

        in the UK by a charity called <a href="http://mysociety.org">MySociety</a>.  The modifications required to 
        make this version in Ireland were developed by John Handelaar.</dd>

        <dt>I&rsquo;d like a site like this for my own location/ where&rsquo;s the "source code" to this site?</dt>
