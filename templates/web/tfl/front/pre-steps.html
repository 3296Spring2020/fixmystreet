    <strong>While we find ourselves in these unprecedented times.</strong>
    All issues reported on Streetcare will continue to be acknowledged as
    we work to keep our roads safe for critical workers to continue to
    support London. We may take longer to respond to you while we concentrate on
    getting issues resolved as our priority. Non-urgent defects may also take longer
    than normal to fix. We will continue to serve you the best that we can but urge
    everyone not to make journeys unless absolutely necessary.
