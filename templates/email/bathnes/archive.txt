Subject: Your reports on [% site_name %]

Hello [% user.name %],

FixMyStreet is being updated in Bath & North East Somerset to improve how problems get reported.

As part of this process, we are closing historic reports which remain open in FixMyStreet.

We noticed that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

If your report is no longer an issue, you don't need to do anything.

If you believe that the issue has not been resolved you can report it again here: https://www.bathnes.gov.uk/reportit
